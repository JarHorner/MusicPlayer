<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wanted to make an addon in World of Warcraft as I am an avid player of the game for awhile. This was an idea a friend and I came up with as we are always wondering what level of mythic plus dungeons drops what, and what the weekly drop will be. We had the table pinned in our discord, but having it as an actual addon is easier and hopefully other people will enjoy having the information readily available. 

### Built With
